# Learning Flutter
A Complete Guide to the Flutter SDK & Flutter Framework for building native IOS and Android apps.
## Requirements
* Basic programming language will help but is not a must-have.
* You can use either Windows, macOS or Linux for Android app development - iOS apps can only be built on macOS though.
* NO prior iOS or Android development experience is required.
* NO prior Flutter or Dart experience is required - this course starts at zero!
